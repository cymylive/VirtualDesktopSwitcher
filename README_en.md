## ✨ Features

- **Hotkey switching**: `Alt + 1` ~ `Alt + 9` to jump directly to the corresponding virtual desktop (keys and modifier keys are customizable)
- **Return to previous desktop**: ``Alt + ` `` to switch back to the previously active virtual desktop
- **Pin window to all desktops**: `Alt + D` to pin (or unpin) the current window to all virtual desktops, keeping it visible across desktop switches.
- **Desktop indicator**: Three display modes — **Symbol indicator** (**◉** current, **○** non-empty, **◌** empty desktops), **Desktop name** (shows the current desktop's name), or **Show both** (name + symbols on two rows). Fully customizable position, size, style, and font.
- **Scroll to switch**: Scroll the mouse wheel while hovering over the indicator to quickly switch to the previous/next virtual desktop.
- **Click to switch**: Left-click a symbol on the indicator to jump directly to that symbol's virtual desktop (disabled in edit mode; drag takes priority).
- **Drag to move**: Drag any window onto an indicator symbol to move it to that virtual desktop and automatically switch to it. Can be configured to require holding **Alt** or **Ctrl** (or disabled entirely).
- **Tray icon shows desktop number**: The tray icon displays the current desktop number — switchable back to the default icon, with customizable number color.
- **Cursor focus**: On multi-monitor setups, moving the mouse cursor between monitors automatically focuses the top window on the target monitor.
- **Extremely lightweight**: Executable ~150KB, memory footprint ~2MB, zero dependencies, runs silently in the background.

## 📝 INI Configuration

Configuration file is saved to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VirtualDesktopSwitcher\settings.ini`. You can customize the keys for switching and pinning virtual desktops in this file.

| Key | Description | Default Value |
|---|---|---|
| `DesktopKey1` ~ `DesktopKey9` | Virtual key codes for desktops 1~9 | `49`\~`57` (keys `1`\~`9`) |
| `PrevDesktopKey` | Virtual key code for returning to previous desktop | `192` (key `` ` ``) |
| `PinAllDesktopsKey` | Virtual key code for pinning/unpinning window to all desktops | `68` (key `D`) |

For virtual key codes, refer to [Virtual-Key Codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes). For example, numpad 1\~9 correspond to `97`\~`105`.

To customize the keys for switching desktops, modify the configuration file according to the table above. For example, use `Alt + qweasdzxc` to switch to desktops `1~9`:

```ini
[General]
DesktopKey1=81    ; Q
DesktopKey2=87    ; W
DesktopKey3=69    ; E
DesktopKey4=65    ; A
DesktopKey5=83    ; S
DesktopKey6=68    ; D
DesktopKey7=90    ; Z
DesktopKey8=88    ; X
DesktopKey9=67    ; C
```

## ⚙️ Run as Administrator & Auto-start

Some applications (e.g., Task Manager) ignore keyboard shortcuts when the switcher runs with normal privileges. Running as administrator resolves this.

- **Run as admin**: Right-click tray icon → `Run as admin`. This setting is persisted — the app will auto-elevate on next launch (UAC prompt will appear).
- **Auto-start (normal privileges)**: Writes to registry `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
- **Auto-start (admin privileges)**: When auto-start is enabled under admin mode, the app automatically creates a **Task Scheduler** login task (`/rl highest`), so startup has no UAC prompts.
- **Clean uninstall**: Tray icon right-click → `Exit` automatically removes both registry keys and scheduled tasks. The program can then be safely deleted without leaving traces.
